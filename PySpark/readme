Multicalss classification using PySpark(Random Forest)

This project for used to productionalized the existing python multiclass classification model on Spark env. using PySpark.
Data is masked for privacy concerns

Approach followed is as folows:
1: null treatment
2: dropped null columns that had more than 70% na data
3: dropped single value columns
4: string to float conversion for MLLIB pipeline
5: removed highly correlated columns
6: NA imputaion
7: Machine learning pipleine:
    7a: String Indexer
    7b: OneHotEncoder
    7c: Vector Assembler
    7d: Random forest multiclass classification

8: prediction
9: Validation using confusion matrix

Trained on 100m+ records
Validated on 25m+ records
