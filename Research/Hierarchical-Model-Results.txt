3. MODEL 1: NULL MODEL (Baseline)
--------------------------------------------------
Fitting null model: ERR ~ 1 + (1|county_group)
✅ Null model fitted successfully
   - Log-likelihood: 2858.29
   - AIC: nan
   - BIC: nan

   - Total variance: 0.004119

   📊 INTRACLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT (ICC): 0.0287
   - This means 2.9% of variance is between counties
   - And 97.1% of variance is within counties (between hospitals)
   - Interpretation: Very low clustering - hierarchical modeling may not be needed

   - Total variance: 0.003811

   📊 VARIANCE EXPLAINED BY HOSPITAL CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Variance reduction: 7.5%
   - Remaining county variance: 2.7%

5. MODEL 3: FULL MODEL (Social Determinants + Hospital Controls)
--------------------------------------------------
Fitting full model: ERR ~ hospital_vars + county_vars + (1|county_group)
❌ Error fitting full model: 
   This might be due to multicollinearity or model complexity
